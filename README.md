- Embedded YouTube video using `<iframe>`
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Custom greeting based on time of day using JavaScript
- JavaScript form validation (name, email, phone, message)
- Dark/Light mode toggle feature (optional)
- Dynamic content toggling on project cards (optional)
- Navigation bar and button interactivity

##  Challenges Faced

- **Responsive design on smaller screens**: 
  Solved using media queries and flexbox/grid layout.
  
- **Image map coordinates and scaling**: 
  Took time to test and fine-tune clickable areas for accurate location targets.

- **Form validation with regex**: 
  Regex for email and phone number validation had to be tested and debugged to ensure proper format.



##  How to Run

1. Extract the `mohamed-portfolio.zip` file.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Ensure `css`, `js`, and `images` folders are in the same directory.
